## Arduino matrix project
  In this repository you will find who itterations of a LED matrix game called Asteroid Storm. The first folder points out the modularisation used to approach the problem, each header being either a IO driver or a layer of the game, while the second  centers around solving the problem, having it better organised while adding some extra functionalities on the game.
